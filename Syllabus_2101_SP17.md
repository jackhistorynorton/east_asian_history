# History 2101: East Asian History with Jack Norton #

_“You can best serve civilization by being against what usually passes for it.”_ Wendell Berry

_“Learning is always rebellion . . . Every bit of new truth discovered is revolutionary to what was believed before.”_ Margaret Lee Runbeck

**Welcome** to East Asian History. This course will be distinctive in three ways: 1. You will help build the course based on your interests and needs. 2. We are going to do a fair amount of digital history. That is, we will study the past by using computing technologies (mostly webpages) to create digital projects. I assume you are able to operate a computer (turn it on, open a browser) and no more. 3. We are going to use _justice_ as our theme for the course. 

The class will be taught in English, with occasional cheesy jokes and mild vulgarities in Spanish.

I want you to learn about the past, learn new skills about how to analyze and present about the past, and learn new ways of _how_ to learn (called metacongition). The learning goals (or outcomes, fit in these three groups. The goals for this course are below. I may sometimes call these learning outcomes, or the stuff I want you to be able to do by the end of this course.  


1.  understand the similarities and differences in the social, cultural,
    and political development of each of these countries.

2.  Place the social, cultural and political development of East Asia as
    a region within a world history context.

3.  Identify specific aspects and historical events which have led to
    the unique character and development of the various countries under
    investigation as well as the region as a whole.

4.  Critically analyze the political, social, and economic structures
    developed by these societies and the impact of these structures on
    world history generally.

5.  Discuss the importance of the cultural achievements of these
    societies and the impact of these achievements on the development of
    world history.

6.  Analyze the historical impact of religious and philosophical beliefs
    and organizations on these societies as well as the impact of these
    beliefs and organizations on the region as a whole.

7.  Articulate, verbally and in writing, their interpretation of the
    historical record using primary and secondary sources.

8.  Improve their critical skills as readers, thinkers, and writers.

9.  Assess the impact of the histories of each country and the region as
    a whole to current events.

*   Write effective historical prose in different genres, such as blogs, historical analyses, and social media.

* Identify and effectively use primary and secondary historical sources for building digital projects.

* Analyze historical sources, including websites, videos, and journal articles, for their credibility.

* Demonstrate the ability to research, evaluate, and present historical material.

**Course Policies**

**Attendance- Attendance is required!** You need to check in with our
course regularly throughout the week. In my face-to-face courses I take attendance. For online courses, I expect you to read, post, and otherwise contribute to D2L at least five times a week. The course grades are set up to reward students who keep up and penalize students who do not. For example, there are no make-up quizzes or discussions, no exceptions.

As an incentive for regular attendance, online-only students who turn in all
their assignments on-time, and miss no discussions or quizzes, will earn
a bonus of 4% on their final grade. the same bonus is available to face-to-face students who have no absences for the entire semester. 
**Grades**

| Grades Items                                  | Weighted Percentage |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Module Assignments                            | 56%                 |

**E-Learning- What you need to know**– *You must use your student email
for all emails to me*. Despite the digital methods of this history course, this is NOT a learn at your own pace course. The due dates for assignments are hard (Fridays at 8 p.m.) and discussion boards close at the same time (for online classes). Online-only education allows you to learn without coming to campus, but it is in fact a more demanding form of college. Online-only students need to be a reasonably skilled keyboardists and comfortable with computer technology. If the words upload, download, convert to pdf, or "As Jon mentioned in his post on religion. . . " are foreign to you, an online-only course might not be the course for you. I want you to succeed, which is why I want you to be honest with yourself about your abilities. Face-to-face courses let me offer real-time support and are generally easier (or so report my students). 

For all my students, to succeed in this course you will need to:

-   Turn on a computer and open a browser. 

-   Watch streaming video from pgs.org and other websites.

-   Navigate the Normandale Library website successfully.

-   Spell check everything.

> If you need technology help, you may call our IT help desk at
> 952-358-8181. Even better, ask them a question on Normandale's “[*Ask
> Us*](http://normandale.custhelp.com/app/home)” page, which will help
> track your request.

**Late Work-** Assignments are due by the 8 p.m. on Friday for the week
of the assignment listed in the course calendar. Assignments handed in
late are penalized 15 points. Late work may be handed in until the D2L
Assignment Submission Folder for late work closes, the penultimate week of class. *Quizzes, in-class responses, and discussions may not be made up.*

**Reading and Writing-** This is a reading and writing-intensive course.
You will read up to 75 pages a week and write at least 16 pages of
typed, doubled-spaced pages of text. Writing guidelines for each
assignment will be discussed in course and included on the assignment.
**All work** will be written in [plain text](http://www.monkeyjob.com/FAQ/What-Plain-Text-File.htm) in the [Markdown](<http://commonmark.org/help/>) syntax. When it comes to formatting your own writing, I assume you know how to turn on a computer, and open a web browser. Everything else I will teach you how to do with careful instructions and diligent follow-ups. 

**Grading-** Written work, unless otherwise noted, will be graded
according to a rubric (a grading chart,) which will be posted at the
time of the assignment. If you are struggling with any assignments,
please do not suffer in silence. Make an appointment with me so that we
can address your questions. I succeed when you succeed.
